            Manchester was one of the fastest growing cities during the
            Industrial Revolution and much so due to a torrent of workers
            arriving from different parts of the British Islands. From a
            relatively small town in the beginning of the 19th century,
            Manchester had passed one million inhabits by 1900 and had become
            one of the biggest cities in Europe. It was great conditions for
            football clubs to emerge; the sport was after all, in its early
            history to a big degree dominated by workers. The club that later
            would become Manchester United FC was initially founded in the year
            1878, named as Newton Heath L&YR Football Club. L&YR as in
            Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Company, which were the company
            there the team's player worked. The team played in the Football
            League for the very first time in 1892 (they should not be confused
            with Manchester Football Club, founded in 1860 and participated in
            the FA Cup in the 1870s before shifting to Rugby). But, they were
            relegated after two years. Next, a new group of local businessmen
            then took over the roles and responsibilities of the club and named
            it as Manchester United in 1902. The newly named club won the title
            of English League in 1908 under the guidance of Ernest Mangnall. The
            first FA Cup trophy was obtained the following year. The team then
            shifted to the current stadium, Old Trafford in 1910. After the
            Second World War, the club had witnessed an extended spell with the
            appointment of Matt Busby in 1945. This visionary leader completely
            reshaped the club and placed a new faith in youngsters, and this
            strategy eventually proved to be astonishingly successful. The
            United team would win the league in 1955–56 and 1956–57. The average
            age were 21 at the first occasion, which made it the youngest side
            ever to win the Football League and earned them the nickname the
            “Busby Babes”.

            It was the second time in Premier League history, since the league's
            inception in 1992, that Manchester United had recorded a 9–0
            victory; the first was in March 1995 against Ipswich Town. The only
            other 9–0 scoreline in the league's history also saw Southampton on
            the losing side, having lost at home to Leicester City in October
            2019. Among the three wins, this was the only one without any player
            scoring a hat-trick. Excluding Bednarek's own goal, Manchester
            United had seven players on the score sheet, equalling the record
            for the most players to have scored for the same team in a single
            match in Premier League history, set by Chelsea in an 8–0 win over
            Aston Villa in December 2012. The result moved Manchester United
            level on points with Manchester City at the top of the Premier
            League table on 44 points, although City's goal difference was still
            better by five goals, despite United's winning margin; City also had
            two games in hand; a 2–0 away win over Burnley the following night
            restored their three-point advantage at the top of the table. City
            and United would finish first and second at the end of the season.
